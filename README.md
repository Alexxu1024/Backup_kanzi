The goal is to provide clean APIs and really fast implementation.
It includes lossless compression codecs (Huffman, Range, LZ4, Snappy, PAQ), color model transforms, resampling, wavelet, DCT, Hadamard transform, bit stream manipulation, Burrows-Wheeler (BWT) and Move-To-Front transform, Run Length coding, etc ...
It also provides video filters such as fast Gaussian filter, Sobel filter and constant time bilateral filter.
